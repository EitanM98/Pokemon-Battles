Pokemon is one of the greatest TV series, this project creates a battleground for Pokemons.
Pokemons and Pokemons' types are generated from an input file ( attached an example file). 
The Pokemons are saved and a CLI menu lets you enter a new pokemon to challenge the strongest
Pokemon. Each Pokemon's type is stronger or weaker against different types, for each battle a calculation is made to match the competitor the strongest contestant and announce the winner. 

* Pokemons types are stored in a generic Linked List and Pokemons of each type are stored in a Maximum Heap.
